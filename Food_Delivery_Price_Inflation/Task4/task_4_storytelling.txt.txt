Task 4 – Storytelling & Business Recommendations

Problem Statement:
Food delivery apps provide convenience, but customers often feel that prices on delivery platforms are higher than dine-in prices.
This project analyzes food delivery price inflation to understand pricing differences and the real impact of discounts.


Key Insights:
1. App prices are consistently higher than dine-in prices for most food items.
2. Even when discounts are displayed, the final app price often remains higher.
3. Swiggy shows slightly higher average price inflation compared to Zomato.
4. Barbecue and Indian cuisines experience the highest price inflation.
5. Some cities show significantly higher inflation than others.


Business Impact:
Customers may unknowingly spend more money when ordering food online.
Regular usage of food delivery apps can increase monthly food expenses.
Price inflation and misleading discounts can reduce customer trust over time.


Recommendations:
1. Customers should compare dine-in and app prices before ordering.
2. Food delivery platforms should improve transparency in pricing.
3. Restaurants can clearly communicate price differences between dine-in and delivery.
4. Platforms should offer genuine discounts instead of inflating base prices.


Conclusion:
The analysis confirms that food delivery platforms often inflate prices compared to dine-in rates.
This project demonstrates how data analytics and visualization can uncover hidden pricing patterns and support informed decision-making.
